**Coding Practice**

Practice coding different data structs & algorithms

Data Structs:
- Singly Linked List




Algorithms:
- Binary Search: 
    * Takes in a **sorted** list, and a string to search for.
    * After each iteration, split the current indexes in half and only search the relevant side
    * *Best Case:* O(1) (Search item is at the initial mid index)
    * *Worst case:* O(log n)
